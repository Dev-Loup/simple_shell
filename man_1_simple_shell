.SH NAME
.B Shellite - a Tiny Shell

.SH SYNOPSIS

.B Shellite

.SH DESCRIPTION

.B Shellite is a simple command interpreter that provides basic functions for interacting with the OS, pipes handling is not provided but Lite shell handles memory management for preventing memory leaks, Lite shell is not meant to be a replacement of BASH, SH or another well-supported shell since lite shell is developed for basic understanding of shell functions

.SH ARGUMENTS

Shellite does not get any arguments

.SH INVOCATION

Shellite does not have any log system.

Interactive mode is available using the following input commands:
.B "SH stands for shell command interpreter that comes with linux" 

SH> liteshell
lsh> echo "input"
lsh> "input"

for going out:

lsh> exit
SH>

while non interactive mode is executed following these commands:

SH> echo "input" | liteshell
SH> "input"

Automatic exit is performed in non interactive mode

When .B Shellite is invoked as interactive program it gets the environment variables for further use and waits for command input, after getting a command shellite executes the first word of input if it's possible.
